# Machine-Learning

This repository is a personal project space for exploring, implementing, and learning about various machine learning algorithms. This will be done both from first principles, and then using pre-built libraries. The goal is to get hands-on practice in these programming tasks, as well as deepening my understanding of the core concepts involved in machine learning. 

## Projects Included

1. Neural Network for Digit Recognition
- Implementation of a feedforward neural network to recognise handwritten digits using MNIST dataset
- Focuses on understanding backpropagation, activation functions, and gradiet descent.
- Performance will be tracked against a test set, with experiments in tuning hyperparameters.

2. Decision Trees & Random Forests
