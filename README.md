# Machine Learning

The purpose of this repository is to gain insight into the most common implementations of Machine Learning algorithms. The goal of this process is to learn the innerworkings of each model including their strengths, weaknesses, limitations, and implementation challenges. The process by which this will  be achieved for each model will be by completing the following key steps to understanding each model completely...

1. Research the model / read relevant documentation & text
2. Implement model from first principles in prefered programming language
3. Implement model using existing libraries which have existing optimization of processes in place
4. Utilise model using real data and compare personal implementaion with industry standard frameworks
5. Experiment with various model hyperparameters to attempt to acheive different results
6. Document and discuss findings / learnings
